This project was made for market research for Tokyo's Airbnb market. Due to the upcoming Olympic Game in 2021, there is higher than normal expectancy in tourism. However, due to rising popularity of Airbnb, study of neighbourhoods and lodging types are core focuses of this project. I applied correlation tables, bar graphs, and case study guidelines to provide a marketing solution to improve Airbnb's revenue in Tokyo.

### SYSTEMS USED
* Python
* Tableau
* Presentation

### Problems to SOLVE
1. Increased number of listings requires discovering ideal neighbourhoods for Airbnb development
2. Overly lower booking prices are detrimental to overall Airbnb regional revenues
3. Lower review scores will lead to less customers and revenues in the future 

### Project GOALS
Increasing overall revenue for Tokyo Airbnb by 40% requires either finding optimal neighborhoods for Airbnb bookings or discovering key variables that increase booking prices
