This project was made for market research for Tokyo's Airbnb market. Due to the upcoming Olympic Game in 2021, there is higher than normal expectancy in tourism. However, due to rising popularity of Airbnb, study of neighbourhoods and lodging types are core focuses of this project. I applied correlation tables, bar graphs, and case study guidelines to provide a marketing solution to improve Airbnb's revenue in Tokyo.
